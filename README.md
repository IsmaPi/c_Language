The way to run this language is by inputting in the "function.mathlang" the code you want to run in our "mathlang" language.

Once that is done go into the IDE terminal and run the following commands in that order:

make

./mathlang.out example/function.mathlang

If you want to clear the project folder from the created files just run: make clean
